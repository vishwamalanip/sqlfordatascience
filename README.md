🚀 Mastering SQL for Data Science – My Self-Written Handbook

SQL is a critical skill for data science, and I’ve built a comprehensive SQL guide from scratch—covering everything from fundamentals to advanced techniques. This resource includes:

✅ Core SQL concepts & best practices

✅ Advanced techniques like CTEs, window functions & joins

✅ Performance tuning & indexing strategies

✅ Real-world data science applications

✅ Hidden SQL tricks for writing efficient queries

I’ve also uploaded some insightful visuals from **Nitish Singh** to make learning even easier. 📸
