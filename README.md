ðŸš€ Mastering SQL for Data Science â€“ My Self-Written Handbook

SQL is a critical skill for data science, and Iâ€™ve built a comprehensive SQL guide from scratchâ€”covering everything from fundamentals to advanced techniques. This resource includes:

âœ… Core SQL concepts & best practices
âœ… Advanced techniques like CTEs, window functions & joins
âœ… Performance tuning & indexing strategies
âœ… Real-world data science applications
âœ… Hidden SQL tricks for writing efficient queries

Iâ€™ve also uploaded some insightful visuals from **Nitish Singh** to make learning even easier. ðŸ“¸
